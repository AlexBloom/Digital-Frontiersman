I am an independent interaction designer from Philadelphia, PA. 
I hold a BFA in graphic & interactive design from the Tyler School of Art, Temple University, where I have also taught interactive design.

Most recently, I worked with the folks at <a href="http://bluecadet.com"target=_blank> Bluecadet, </a> building a number of websites for companies large and small. Before that I worked at several <a href="http://fortfranklin.com"target=_blank>advertising</a> and design agencies and freelanced with <a href="http://theheadsofstate.com"target=_blank>these dudes.</a>

I have worked in a team and directly for the following clients: National Geographic, Wired UK, Bike & Build, Tribeca Film Institute, Stowe Mountain Resort, University of Pennsylvania, Litl, Danvers Bank, and Spin Magazine.  

My work has been recognized by Communication Arts, AIGA, CMYK Magazine, The AD Club, and The One Club. I am currently living in a van, down by the national parks of America.
